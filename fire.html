<h3 id="id1">What are Fires?</h3>
Fire is the visible effect of the process of combustion â€“ a special type of chemical reaction. It occurs between oxygen in the air and some sort of fuel. The products from the chemical reaction are completely different from the starting material.
<br />
Fire generates a black, impenetrable smoke that blocks vision and stings the eye. It is impossible to navigate through suck smoke, so fire drill participants should practice evacuating houses/buildings by at least two routes.

<h3 id="id2">Causes of Fires</h3>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Dead leaves
<li>Faulty electrical wiring
<li>Faulty electrical equipment
<li>Unattended stoves and ovens
<li>Unattended candles
<li>Children playing with fire
<li>Flammable liquid
<li>Careless smoking
<br />
<br />
<br />
<li><strong>Dried Leaves</strong> - Remember to clean the areas in and around your house regularly. You should immediately dispose of dried leaves, wood shavings, and other items that may easily catch fire. 
<li><strong>Faulty Electrical Wiring</strong> - To protect your family, hire a licensed electrician to check your electrical installations regularly. Ask them to repair or replace frayed or faulty wiring and fixtures.
<li><strong>Faulty Electrical Equipment</strong> - Appliances and gadgets should not be plugged in when not in use.
<li><strong>Unattended Stoves and Ovens</strong> - Always pay attention to your cooking. Place combustibles like paper towels and rags away from heat sources.
<li><strong>Unattended Candles</strong> - For a safe space, keep your candles on a sturdy holder on an even surface. Make sure that they are out of reach of children and pets and always blow them out before leaving the room.
<li><strong>Children Playing With Fire</strong> - Always keep your matches, lighters, and torches in places that the children cannot reach.
<li><strong>Flammable Liquid</strong> - Always store flammable liquids in approved containers in a cool, ventilated area outside your home.
<li><strong>Careless Smoking</strong> - Clean the ashtrays regularly and place them away from materials that burn easily.</ul>

<h3 id="id3">The Fire Triangle</h3>
The Fire Triangle or Combustion Triangle is a simple model for understanding the necessary elements that start most fires. The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite: heat, fuel, and oxygen.
<br />
Fire is composed of three elements - heat, fuel, and oxygen. which when combined, will result in a chemical reaction called <b>burning</b>. The leading cause of death in a fire is <b>asphyxiation</b> (Choking Sensation). Inhaling carbon monoxide can cause loss of consciousness or death within minutes. The heat from a hostile fire exceeds anything to which a person is normally exposed. A fully developed room fire has temperatures over 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit

<h3 id="id4">What to do?</h3>
<b>Preventive Measures</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Put phone numbers of the fire department near your land-line phone.
<li>Do not smoke in bed, especially after drinking.
<li>Eliminate fire hazards through good housekeeping. Dispose of waste paper, rubbish, and other flammable materials regularly.<br />
<li>Keep matches and lighters out of children's reach.
<li>Do not leave cooking appliances running.
<li>DO not use a broken plug or pull a plug out of an outlet by the cord as this may cause overheating and possibly even a fire.
<li>Keep a First Aid Kit handy.
</ul>
<br />
<b>But what if there's a Fire?</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>We all try to prevent fire starting in our home. But it only takes an unguarded or careless moment for a fire to start. A couple of minutes later and your home could be filled with smoke. Smoke can fumes can kill - particularly the highly poisonous smoke from some furnishings. You will only have a short time to get out. Use it wisely and try not to panic.
<li>If possible, close the door of the room where the fire is and close all doors behind you as you leave. This will help delay the spread of fire and smoke.
<li>After the first sign of fire, make every attempt to put it out. The first 3 minutes is critical as it is still containable with fire extuingishers. Thereafter, the nearest fire alarm should be sounded.
<li>CALL FOR HELP.
<br />
<br />
<b>And after?</b>
<li>Treat any injuries on yourself.
<li>Report to the nearest authority.
</ul>
