    <td width="560">An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.
    
Earthquakes strike suddenly and violently and can occur at any time, day or night, throughout the year. Smaller earthquakes might crack some windows and shake products off store shelves, but larger earthquakes can cause death and massive destruction, devastating communities and debilitating local economies.

An earthquake is a feeble shaking to violent trembling of the ground produced by the sudden displacement of rocks or rock materials below the earth's surface.

Tectonic earthquakes are generated by the sudden displacement along faults in the solid and rigid layer of the earth. Volcanic earthquakes are induced by rising magma beneath active volcanoes.

    <td width="560">Earthquakes occur when large sections of the Earths’ crust — called tectonic plates — shift. There are seven primary tectonic plates (African, Antarctic, Eurasian, Indo-Australian, North American, Pacific, and South American) and a number of smaller, secondary and tertiary plates. Because of underlying movement in the Earth’s mantle, these plates can shift.</td>
