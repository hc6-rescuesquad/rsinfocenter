    <td width="560">An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.
    
Earthquakes strike suddenly and violently and can occur at any time, day or night, throughout the year. Smaller earthquakes might crack some windows and shake products off store shelves, but larger earthquakes can cause death and massive destruction, devastating communities and debilitating local economies.

An earthquake is a feeble shaking to violent trembling of the ground produced by the sudden displacement of rocks or rock materials below the earth's surface.

Tectonic earthquakes are generated by the sudden displacement along faults in the solid and rigid layer of the earth. Volcanic earthquakes are induced by rising magma beneath active volcanoes.

    <td width="560">Earthquakes occur when large sections of the Earths’ crust — called tectonic plates — shift. There are seven primary tectonic plates (African, Antarctic, Eurasian, Indo-Australian, North American, Pacific, and South American) and a number of smaller, secondary and tertiary plates. Because of underlying movement in the Earth’s mantle, these plates can shift.</td>

What to do before an earthquake?
<ul type="disc">
<li>Determine whether the site is along an active fault and/or prone to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_liquefaction">liquefaction</a> or landslide which may cause damage to your house or building</li>
<br />
<li>Plan ahead with your family in case of an earthquake. Decide on a place to meet in the event  that you are separated.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
What to do during an earthquake?
<ul type="disc">
<li>Stay calm</li>
<li>If you are inside a structurally sound building, stay there.</li>
<li>Protect your body from falling debris by staying in stronger parts of the building like near coluumns and beams, outside the elevator shaft, or by getting under a sturdy desk or table. Remember, Duck, Cover, and Hold on!</li>
</ul>
<br />
What to do after an earthquake?
<ul type="disc">
<li>Once the shaking stops, take the fastest and safest way out of the building.</li>
<li>Get out in a calm and orderly manner. Don't panic.</li>
<li>Check your surroundings. Be safe.</li>
<li>If you must evacuate your residence, leave a message stating where are you going.</li>
</ul>
